# Introduction
## Unraveling the Mysteries of Weather: An Analytical Approach


### Exploring the Atmosphere Through Data
Weather, a phenomenon as old as Earth itself, has long been a subject of human fascination and inquiry. The intricate dance of temperature, wind, and precipitation shapes our environment, affects our lives, and challenges our understanding of the natural world. With the advent of technology and data analysis techniques, we are now poised to dive deeper into these complex processes. Our project, "Weather Data Analysis Using Regression and Classification on ERA5 Dataset," aims to contribute to this ongoing exploration by examining how different variables interact to create complex weather phenomena.

#### Geographic Focus: Bancroft, Canada
While our project leverages the ERA5 dataset, we have chosen to specifically focus on Bancroft in Canada, for an in-depth analysis. This decision is rooted in the unique climatic and meteorological characteristics of the region, which offer a distinctive case study for understanding complex weather phenomena. Bancroft's location and environmental conditions provide a microcosm for examining the interactions between various atmospheric variables, making it an ideal setting for applying our regression and classification analyses to real-world data. This focused approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of weather patterns and their impacts in a specific geographic context.

### The Impetus for Investigation
Our motivation is rooted in both historical interest and present-day necessity. As highlighted in a systematic review titled "The contribution of weather forecast information to agriculture, water, and energy sectors in East and West Africa," accurate weather prediction is crucial for effective agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning, particularly in the context of climate change risks[^1]. The Lake Effect, illustrated in "A Hybrid Dataset of Historical Cool-Season Lake Effects From the Eastern Great Lakes of North America,", is a phenomenon where cold winds moving over warmer lake waters can cause significant changes in weather patterns nearby, is a example of the complexity in weather systems [^2]. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and its ERA5 dataset provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze detailed weather parameters over several decades. This data, examined for its comprehensiveness in the "Evaluation of spatial-temporal variation performance of ERA5 precipitation data in China," is a valuable resource for researchers seeking to understand weather patterns and atmospheric dynamics[^3].
This dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of weather patterns and atmospheric dynamics across different regions, including phenomena such as the Lake Effect, which exemplifies the intricate relationship between wind direction and temperature

### The Research Question: A Dual Perspective
Our research is guided by two pivotal questions, addressed through regression and classification analyses:

#### Regression Analysis: 
How accurately can we predict temperature and its relationship with wind characteristics using historical data? This question is inspired by the current understanding of atmospheric variables and their interactions.
#### Classification Analysis:
Can we effectively classify and predict weather events, including extreme occurrences, based on multivariate weather data? This aspect of the research aims to develop methods for accurate prediction of weather events, acknowledging the complexity and variability of weather patterns.

These questions are designed to leverage the depth of the ERA5 dataset, exploring correlations, causations, and patterns that govern weather phenomena.

### Hypotheses and Anticipated Discoveries
Our hypotheses are twofold, corresponding to our dual analytical approach:

In Regression: We hypothesize that there exists a significant correlation between temperature and wind characteristics, which can be modeled to predict future temperature trends and variations. This hypothesis is based on the premise that atmospheric variables are interconnected and can be analyzed to forecast weather conditions.

In Classification: We anticipate that specific patterns in the weather data can accurately predict various weather events, including extreme conditions. This hypothesis is informed by the need for effective prediction models in the face of increasingly frequent and severe weather events.

### Methodological Insights and Impact
We intend to employ a range of statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the ERA5 dataset. The outcomes of this research are expected to not only enhance meteorological understanding but also provide practical tools for weather prediction, with implications for environmental policy and public safety.

In conclusion, this project represents an intersection of historical interest and modern analytical capability. By harnessing the power of the ERA5 dataset and advanced analytical techniques, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the field of meteorology and support informed decision-making in a world increasingly affected by weather-related challenges.


## Methodology Overview
This project uses a multifaceted approach, primarily utilizing Design Science Research (DSR) in line with Hesse's framework[^4]. This methodological framework focuses on the creation and critical evaluation of artifacts to address specific problems. In our DSR approach, we identify and define complex weather phenomena as problems to be addressed. Additionally, iterative prototyping is employed, enabling systematic refinement of models and methods based on continuous evaluation and integration of data-driven insights[^5]. This project combines the DSR cycle by Hesse, with iterative prototyping. This integration fosters a dynamic environment where each prototype's development and evaluation progressively inform subsequent cycles of design and analysis. This leads us into a cycle of artifact creation (in our case, models and algorithms) specifically tailored to analyze weather patterns in Bancroft using the ERA5 dataset. These models will be refined continuously through iterative prototyping, where each iteration's outcomes inform the next cycle, ensuring they are increasingly effective and accurate. The artifacts are then rigorously evaluated against our research questions related to temperature prediction and weather event classification.  This process is enriched by a comprehensive literature review, ensuring our methods and analyses remain aligned with current meteorological and data science advancements. The amalgamation of DSR, iterative prototyping, and literature research forms the foundation of our approach, ensuring a thorough and robust analysis that is well-suited to address the complexities inherent in atmospheric data analysis.
