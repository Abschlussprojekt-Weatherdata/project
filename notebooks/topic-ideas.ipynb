    "### Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Temperature Prediction:* Can we build an accurate regression model to predict temperature based on historical data? This involves exploring the relationships between temperature time (daytime, day, season, etc.). The result of this regression analysis is the identification of a trend in the weather data as well the prediction of the temperature for the next x days, weeks, etc. based on the historical weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Temperature and Wind Modeling:* Can we find a correlation or causation between the temperature and windspeed, windgust or winddirection using regression techniques? This involves investigating the impact of independent variables (wind features) on the temperature. The result of this regression analysis is the identification of the correlation or causation between wind features and the temperature based on the historical weather.\n",
    "As an outlook to this analysis it could also be analyzed whether certain winddirections result in a certain type of weather event (classification?).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Extreme Weather Events:* Can we classify and predict extreme weather events such as storms? This involves training a binary classification model to identify patterns indicative of extreme events. The result of this classification analysis is the prediction of extreme weather events based on the current weather data and a model that was trained on historical weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Weather Event and Pattern Classification:* Is it possible to categorize and predict different weather patterns (e.g., clear skies, rain, snow, etc.) based on multivariate weather data? This involves using multiclass classification algorithms. The results of this classification analysis is the predection of certain weather events based on the current weather data and a model that was trained on historical weather data.\n",
